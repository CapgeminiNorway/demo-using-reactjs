# using-reactjs
Learn-Make using React.js  

The main goal is to present functional demo by using emerging frameworks. *Learn -> Make -> Share!*      
This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebookincubator/create-react-app).  
And we are using [React.js](https://facebook.github.io/react/), [admin-on-rest](https://marmelab.com/admin-on-rest/), [material.ui](http://www.material-ui.com/#/), [react-vis](https://uber.github.io/react-vis), and few more open source libs.
