# demo-using-reactjs
Demo Playground using React.js  

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebookincubator/create-react-app).  
And we are using [React.js](https://facebook.github.io/react/), [admin-on-rest](https://marmelab.com/admin-on-rest/), [material.ui](http://www.material-ui.com/#/), [react-vis](https://uber.github.io/react-vis), and few more open source libs.      

**Learning by Doing..!**  
This project's goal is to present functional demo by using emerging frameworks. Show, don't tell! :-)
